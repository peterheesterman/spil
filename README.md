# Spil

A lispy experiment to maximise learning.

I don't know lisp but I would love to learn more about it. Instead of just learning the language I am writing spil, my own interpreter for something lispy in flavour.

### Notes to self:
 - " are not valid, all literals must start and end with '

### Todos: 
 - [ ] add true and false
 - [ ] build AST
